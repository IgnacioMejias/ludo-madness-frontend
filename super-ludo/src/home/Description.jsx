            <p>Ludo-Madness is a modified version of the classic board game Ludo, 
                which includes special features to make it more exciting and 
                challenging. One of the unique features is the inclusion of a special 
                dice that allows players to eat any opponent's piece if they land on a 
                specific square. Additionally, there are other special squares that can 
                help players advance more quickly or block their opponents. The objective 
                of the game remains the same: to move all the pieces from the starting 
                point to the finishing point, but with these special features, Super-Ludo 
                becomes an even more thrilling gaming experience.</p>
